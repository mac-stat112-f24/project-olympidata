# Olympidata

The goal of this project was to take the Olympic data we obtained from Tidytuesday and examine what variables would affect success within the olympics. The requirements of this project was for us to showcase our newly learned data science skills such as creating effective vizualizations, data wrangling, and EDA.

To run this analysis utilize Rstudio 4.3.1 and the packages tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr. After installing head to the build section of rstudio and select render book. 

Limitations of this study is that the sample we selected was not necessarily representative of the full summer and winter olympic sports selection.
